### Motivating questions that you will try to address in the project.

What offensive and defensive features are the best predictor of in-game success? What is the correlation between offensive and defense? MSU statistics and predictions/probabilities for next season.

### What do you expect to learn?

We expect to learn the fundamental skills and knowledge necessary for effective programming and software development. This includes gaining proficiency in programming languages, understanding data structures, mastering algorithms, and interpreting data/statistics. We anticipate acquiring problem-solving abilities and the ability to break down complex issues into manageable components. Furthermore, we aim to learn about web development technologies, coding standards, debugging techniques, and best practices for writing clean and efficient code. We look forward to hands-on projects that will allow us to apply our skills, as well as the opportunity to work collaboratively with others on coding tasks.

### What methods do you plan to use to achieve your goal?

Data frame manipulation and data summarization (dplyr)

Computing and interpreting summary statistics

Exploratory data analysis on structure of variables and their distributions

Data visualization and graphical representations using plots and graphs (ggplot)

Analyzation of plots/graphs to determine variable relationships/contrasts


### What is your groupâ€™s plan to facilitate working collaboratively on the project?

Clear Communication: Ensure that all team members understand the importance of clear and effective communication. Establish communication channels (email, messaging apps, project management tools) and guidelines for regular updates and discussions.

Roles and Responsibilities: Define specific roles and responsibilities for each team member based on their skills and expertise. This prevents confusion and ensures everyone knows their tasks.

Project Objectives: Clearly define the project's objectives and goals, making sure every team member understands the purpose and desired outcomes to maintain a shared vision.

Project Timeline: Establish a project timeline with milestones and deadlines. This provides a structured framework for project progress and helps with time management.

Collaboration Tools: Make use of collaboration tools such as project management software, shared document repositories, and communication platforms to facilitate efficient collaboration and resource sharing.
